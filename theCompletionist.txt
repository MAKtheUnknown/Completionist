For Prototype (Due July 4, midnight): 
	- Physics and collision detection (hitbox) should be ready to go
	- Decide how many levels and what levels will contain
	- Figure out how to link up levels so that transition between them is easy
	- Different styles of boss battles(?) (turn based / platform)
	- Start making/finding sprites/sound files and add to resources

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




Boss levels: 
	- *Sans (mechanic 1 - dodging shit)
	- FFIV Boss (mechanic 2 - turn based)
	- *Bowser (mechanic 3 - platform)
	- Castlevania(?)
	- Megaman (yellow devil maybe)
	- *Sinistar




Concerns:
	- Have to have a main mechanic so that it doesn't get too hectic
		- Make simple so that bosses and character is limited to D-Pad and 2 buttons
	- Sprites
		- finding them might be hard


Ideas:
	- Constant health bar - health doesn't regen per level; stays the same throughout
	- Same sprite throughout(can be super generic lookin dude)
	- 


Classes we need:
	- Class for main character (extend AnimatedSprite class)
	- Event (for health)
	- physics when neeeded
	- tweening 
	- general interface for each level that has controls, physics 
	- level manager class
	- sound manager
